                                The objectives of our audit are to obtain
                                reasonable
                                assurance about whether the financial
                                statements as
                                a
                                whole
                                are free from material misstatement, whether
                                due to
                                fraud
                                or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that
                                includes
                                our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high
                                level
                                of
                                assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit
                                conducted in
                                accordance with International Standards on
                                Auditing
                                (ISAs)
                                will always detect a material misstatement when
                                it
                                exists.
                                Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and
                                are
                                considered material if, individually or in the
                                aggregate,
                                they could reasonably be expected to influence
                                the
                                economic
                                decisions of users taken on the basis of these
                                financial
                                statements.

                            <p>
                                Our function as auditors are in accordance with
                                Law
                                regulating the audit profession promulgated by
                                Royal
                                decree
                                77 of 1986, and its amendments.

                            <p>
                                We will conduct our audit in accordance with
                                ISAs.
                                Those
                                standards require that we comply with ethical
                                requirements.
                                As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we
                                exercise
                                professional judgment and maintain professional
                                skepticism
                                throughout the audit. We also:

                                <li>Identify and assess the risks of material
                                    misstatement
                                    of the financial statements, whether due to
                                    the
                                    fraud
                                    or error, design and perform, audit
                                    procedures
                                    responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
                                    evidence
                                    that Is sufficient and appropriate to
                                    provide a
                                    basis
                                    of our opinion. The risk of not detecting a
                                    material
                                    misstatement resulting from fraud is higher
                                    than

                                    one resulting from error, as fraud may
                                    involve
                                    collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,
                                    misrepresentations, or the override of
                                    internal
                                    control.

                                    are
                                    appropriate in the circumstances, but not

                                    in our auditor’s report to the related

                                    inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our

                                    are

                            Because of the inherent limitations of an audit,

                                    time of engagement, the Firm represents
                                    that there are no conflicts of interest,
                                    for services to be rendered under this
                                    engagement, and the Firm’s services and
                                    employment with other parties. If, during
                                    the course of this engagement, the Firm
                                    becomes aware of facts which constitute or
                                    may give rise to a conflict of interest,
                                    the Firm shall advise the Client. In such
                                    an event, the Firm and the Client will
                                    mutually determine appropriate action for
                                    managing the conflict of interest.

                                    interest does not arise merely because the
                                    Firm is providing, or may provide, services
                                    to other clients in the same or similar

                            uncertainty exists, we are
                            required to draw attention in our auditor’s report
                            to the related disclosures in the financial
                            statements or, if such
                            disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion.
                            Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence
                            obtained up to
                            the date of our auditor’s report. However, future
                            events or conditions may cause the Entity to cease
                            to continue as a
